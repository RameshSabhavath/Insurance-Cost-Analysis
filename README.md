# ðŸ“Œ Insurance-Cost-Analysis with Python

Project Overview :

Conduct analytical study on a curated medical insurance charges dataset. Dataset adapted from Medical Insurance Price Prediction
### Objective : 
â€¢ Identify primary factors affecting insurance costs and develop predictive models
### ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
â€¢ Python v3.12.2 â€“ programming environment
â€¢ Pandas â€“ data manipulation and preprocessing  
â€¢ NumPy â€“ statistical and mathematical operations    
â€¢ Scikit-learn â€“ machine learning algorithms, pipelines, and evaluation     
â€¢ Seaborn â€“ advanced data visualization     
â€¢ Matplotlib â€“ flexible plotting and charting

### ðŸ“Š Dashboards & Analysis

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualized distributions of charges by smoker status, BMI ranges, and regions.
* Correlation heatmaps identified smoking & BMI as dominant predictors of cost.
  
ðŸ’« Project Achievements 

â†’ Identified key cost drivers: smoking status (strongest), BMI, age, and number of children significantly impact insurance charges.  
â†’ Developed Linear Regression model with only smoker attribute â†’ RÂ² = 0.62 (baseline).   
â†’ Expanded to all features â†’ RÂ² improved to 0.75, showing better prediction power.    
â†’ Applied Polynomial Regression â†’ achieved RÂ² = 0.84, capturing non-linear relationships.    
â†’ Used Ridge Regression with Polynomial Features â†’ further improved to RÂ² = 0.85, reducing overfitting.

### ðŸ“ˆ Trend Analysis:
* Insurance cost increases with age & BMI.
* Smokers incur ~79% higher charges on average.
* Regional variation minimal, indicating location is less significant.

### ðŸ”¹ Project Findings & Outcomes

âœ… Achieved 85% RÂ² accuracy using Linear, Polynomial & Ridge Regression. Identified smoking, BMI & age as key cost drivers, enabling optimized pricing strategies.  
âœ… Built predictive models using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn; achieved 85% (RÂ²) accuracy in forecasting insurance costs.  
âœ… Uncovered key cost drivers (smoking, BMI, age) and delivered insights to optimize pricing strategies and reduce financial risks.  
âœ… Smoking (~55%), BMI (~20%), and age (~15%) emerged as dominant cost drivers, jointly shaping most of the prediction power.     
âœ… Final Accuracy Achieved : ~85% (RÂ² = 0.8537)
