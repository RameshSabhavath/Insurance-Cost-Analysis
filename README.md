# Insurance-Cost-Analysis
Data Analysis with Python

Project Overview

### Insurance Cost Analysis

Conduct analytical study on a curated medical insurance charges dataset
Dataset adapted from Medical Insurance Price Prediction (Kaggle, CC0 1.0 License)

### Objective : 
• Identify primary factors affecting insurance costs and develop predictive models

### Tools & Technologies
• Python v3.12.2 – programming environment
• Pandas – data manipulation and preprocessing
• NumPy – statistical and mathematical operations
• Scikit-learn – machine learning algorithms, pipelines, and evaluation
• Seaborn – advanced data visualization
• Matplotlib – flexible plotting and charting

### Deliverables

• Load and clean dataset (handle missing values)
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key cost drivers
• Build univariate and multivariate Linear Regression models
• Apply Ridge Regression for improved model robustness
• Develop regression-based predictive model


### Analytical Proces

• Import dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
• Clean and preprocess data (address missing/inconsistent entries)
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Construct regression models:
• Univariate Linear Regression
• Multivariate Linear Regression
• Analysing the patterns by vizualizing the data from various columns
• Apply Ridge Regression to reduce multicollinearity and enhance accuracy
